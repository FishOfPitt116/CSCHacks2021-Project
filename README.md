# CSCHacks2021-Project

## Project Description

Through our game, we are looking to learn more about game development, using the skills we've developed from our
academic work. We're looking to learn about:
- The game dev process
- Bug Fixing
- Updates; feature adding & removal
- New frameworks (perhaps Unity?)
